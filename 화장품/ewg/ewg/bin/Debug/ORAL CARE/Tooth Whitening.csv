Warnings from packaging:
Important Usage Information: Caution: Keep out of reach of young children. Not intended for use in children under the age of 18. Do not swallow plastic strips. Crest 3D White Whitestrips is not a substitute for regular dental care. Visit your dentist regularly. Avoid contact of gel with eyes, cloth, leather, or fabric. Gel that comes into contact with the skin can cause temporary skin irritation and/or whitening. Tooth Sensitivity \u0026 Gum Discomfort: With all whitening products you may experience tooth sensitivity and/or gum discomfort. With products that offer the highest level of whitening at retail such as Crest 3D White Whitestrips, there is an even greater chance that you may experience tooth sensitivity and/or gum discomfort. These effects are generally mild. These effects are temporary and not harmful. If you are in need of dental work, have dental work, or have staining from medication, ask your dentist if whitening is appropriate. Crest 3D White Whitestrips are designed to hold well to teeth. Do not use on loose teeth, restorations, or braces. Crest 3D White Whitestrips will only whiten natural teeth. The strips will not whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings, or dentures.","Product's animal testing policies,PETA Cruelty-free Companies"
